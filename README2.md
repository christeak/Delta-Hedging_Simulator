This code allows you to visualize the delta-hedging of a Call option in a portfolio across time. 
By executing it, it will ask you to enter the value of different parameters, such as the volatility or the number of days for instance.
Note that these values will then remain the same during the execution.
The result is the visualization of the portfolio value during the process and the value of the underlying asset during that same time.
